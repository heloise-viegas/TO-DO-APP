## To Do App

As the name suggests ,this is a simpe TO-DO app.
It has the following screens : Login,homePage,Add task,All Tasks,and App drawer.

A user can log in directly using his/her google account.Using Firebase Authenticator ,the user's name and profile image is pulled from google and displayed on the screen.
The Home screen shows only tasks's for the current day.This was acchieved by querying the Firestore Collection.It also displays the tasks per weekday.

I have implemented CRUD opereations on Firestore in this project.![Uploading Screenshot_20210524-110738.jpgâ€¦]![Screenshot_20210524-110813](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37453877/119326305-611c5200-bc9f-11eb-9f89-7441ca5f3127.jpg)
